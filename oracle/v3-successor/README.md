# Versioned successor fixture generator

Uses the pinned nearcore validator and existing D3 chain/witness generator. It is a separate
package from the signed oracle. Set `NEAR_SUCCESSOR_CONTRACT` to a Wasm file to replace only the
`d3float` test account code (its called method is `run`). Missing/empty configured files fail.
Without that variable the code registry is identical to the baseline.

Record the binary, contract, input/output hashes and generator seed with each run. Existing
D3 classifications describe the baseline; a newly generated runtime-error or global family
needs explicit successor expectations. Do not relabel generated evidence as the pinned corpus.

Build after `bash oracle/scripts/link-nearcore.sh`:
`cargo build --release --manifest-path oracle/v3-successor/Cargo.toml`.
The CLI is the existing D3 generator CLI; `gen --domain d3 --seed S --chains K --blocks N --out DIR`.
